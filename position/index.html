        <h2>Information about positioning:</h2>
        <p>
          <b>static</b> Most basic - standard positioning from browses, What is
          first in html wil be first renederd, what is second will be rendered
          after the first
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>relative</b> Same as static but as additional you can set top,
          left, right, bottom properties - but rest of the elements will be
          rendered together with this with relative positioning. That can cause
          problems with paddings, margins etc. But can be used as contained for
          absolute element
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>absolute</b> Element is rendered oudside the document flow, So all
          the html page will be rendered, then somewhere element with absolute
          position will be placed. Element have top, left,right,bottom
          properties. Very useful when we want stic something to parent element.
          Be aware that absolute element wil be positionet to the next element
          that is not static, so when you need position something inside parent
          element that parent must have position relative or absolute
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>fixed</b> Element is rendered oudside the document flow, So all the
          html page will be rendered, then somewhere element with fixed position
          will be placed. Element have top, left,right,bottom properties.
          Difference betwen absolute is that: fixed element innores parents
          element and relates directly to root html element, even with scroling
          something can be pleced in the middle os the screen or on the top like
          navbar
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>sticky</b> Element is normalny (static) rendered - but when it
          reach sticky position, in example top: will stick to that eaven fo
          scrolled down. like Fixed
